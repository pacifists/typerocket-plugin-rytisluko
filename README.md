This plugin uses TypeRocket as the backbone for it's functionality.

The purpose is to have Wordpress interact with Xperiencify platform.

It's possible to link Woocommerce product with XP course and then after purchase the user is added as a new student to XP course that was linked to the product.

Also there are few helper functions - Elementor Dynamic Tag that allows to fetch the Xperiencify course magick link on the Thank you page.

Shortcode for listing the courses which link directly to Xperiencify wherever you want - I used My Account for that on my project.
